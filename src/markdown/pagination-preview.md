### Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts

Sustainable Development Goal 13 is to _“take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts”_, [according to the United Nations](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/climate-change/).

The visualizations and data below present the global perspective on where the world stands today and how it has changed over time. Further data and statistics can be found at the Our World in Data topic pages on CO2 and Greenhouse Gas Emissions and [Climate Change](https://ourworldindata.org/climate-change).

The [UN has defined](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/Global%20Indicator%20Framework%20after%202023%20refinement_Eng.pdf) 5 targets and 8 indicators for SDG 13. Targets specify the goals and indicators represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these targets are achieved. Below we quote the original text of all targets and show the data on the agreed indicators.

### Integration of climate change into national policies

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nationally-determined-contributions" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

**Definition of the SDG indicator:** Indicator 13.2.1 is the “number of countries with nationally determined contributions, long-term strategies, national adaptation plans and adaptation communications, as reported to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change” in the [UN SDG framework](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/Global%20Indicator%20Framework%20after%202023%20refinement_Eng.pdf).

National commitments within the [UNFCCC Paris Agreement](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement) vary by country depending on their [Nationally Determined Contributions (NCDs)](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/nationally-determined-contributions-ndcs) so are not directly comparable.

In the interactive chart you can see the number of countries that have submitted nationally determined contributions (NDCs). In the additional charts below you will find data on national CO2 emissions, per capita emissions and carbon intensity measures to track progress on emissions reductions.

**Target:** By 2030 “integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.”

**More research:** Further data and research on this topic can be found at the _Our World in Data_ topic page on [CO](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions)[2](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions) [and Other Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

#### Additional charts

- [Carbon dioxide emissions intensity](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-intensity?tab=map)
- [Carbon dioxide emissions per capita](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita)

### Total greenhouse gas emissions per year

<iframe src="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-ghg-emissions" loading="lazy" style="width: 100%; height: 600px; border: 0px none;"></iframe>

**Definition of the SDG indicator:** Indicator 13.2.2 is the “total greenhouse gas emissions per year” in the [UN SDG framework](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/Global%20Indicator%20Framework%20after%202023%20refinement_Eng.pdf).

The ultimate aim of the [United Nations Climate Change Convention](https://unfccc.int/) is to achieve the stabilization of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.

GHG emissions are measure in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents because each greenhouse gas has a different warming effects: one tonne of methane does not have the same impact on warming as one tonne of CO2. Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) attempt to convert the warming impact of the range of greenhouse gases into a single metric.

**Target:** By 2030 “integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.”

**More research:** Further data and research on this topic can be found at the _Our World in Data_ topic page on [Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions).

#### Human greenhouse gas emissions have increased global average temperatures

Human [emissions of carbon dioxide](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/climate-change?facet%3Dnone%26country%3DOWID_WRL~ATA~Gulkana%2BGlacier~Lemon%2BCreek%2BGlacier~OWID_NAM~South%2BCascade%2BGlacier~Wolverine%2BGlacier~Hawaii%26Metric%3DCO%25E2%2582%2582%2Bconcentrations%26Long-run%2Bseries%3Dfalse&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1695580773696470&usg=AOvVaw2uBJlE-bFm6ORuj-K-Bz0P) and other greenhouse gases are the primary drivers of the global rise in temperatures.[1](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions#note-1) This link between global temperatures and greenhouse gas concentrations – especially CO2 – has been true throughout Earth’s history.[2](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions#note-2)

In the chart, we see the global average temperature relative to a baseline, which is the average between 1961 and 1990. Average temperatures have risen by over 0.8°C since then.

You can also see that temperatures in 1850 were around 0.4°C cooler than the baseline, giving us a total temperature rise of about 1.2°C compared to pre-industrial times.

This warming has not been equally distributed across the world. The Northern Hemisphere has warmed more than the Southern Hemisphere. And warming has been especially strong at the poles. In some regions, temperatures have risen by more than 5°C. You can see this distribution in maps [published by](https://berkeleyearth.org/global-temperature-report-for-2022/) Berkeley Earth.

Human emissions have been the main driver of this change. Aerosols have played a slight cooling role in global climate, and natural variability has played a minor role. [This article](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-why-scientists-think-100-of-global-warming-is-due-to-humans) from Carbon Brief explains this very well, with interactive graphics showing the relative contributions of different factors on the climate.

##### **WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THIS DATA**

- This data comes from the United Kingdom’s [Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/) and combines air and sea surface temperatures in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. It is called the “HadCRUT” (Hadley Centre/Climatic Research Unit Temperature) dataset.[3](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions#note-3)
- It measures temperature anomalies across the world at high resolutions.
- There is [very strong agreement](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadcrut5/) in temperature trends across the large global datasets measured and produced by other leading institutions.

The lack of access to these technologies causes some of the worst global problems of our time.

When people lack access to modern energy sources for cooking and heating, they rely on solid fuel sources – mostly firewood, but also dung and crop waste. This comes at a massive cost to the health of people in energy poverty: [indoor air pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution), which the WHO calls "the world's largest single environmental health risk."[3](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-3) For the poorest people in the world it is [the largest risk factor](https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution#indoor-air-pollution-is-the-leading-risk-factor-for-premature-death-in-poor-countries) for early death and global health research suggests that indoor air pollution is [responsible for 1.6 million deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death#risk-factors-for-death) each year, twice the death count of poor sanitation.[4](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-4)

The use of wood as a source of energy also has a negative impact on the environment around us. The reliance on fuelwood is the reason why poverty is linked to deforestation. The FAO reports that on the African continent the reliance on wood as fuel is the single most important driver of forest degradation.[5](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-5) Across East, Central, and West Africa fuelwood provides more than half of the total energy.[6](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-6)

Lastly, the lack of access to energy subjects people to a life in poverty. No electricity means no refrigeration of food; no washing machine or dishwasher; and no light at night. You might have seen the photos of children [sitting under a street lamp at night](https://marroninstitute.nyu.edu/blog/students-studying-under-streetlights) to do their homework.[7](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-7)

The first energy problem of the world is the problem of energy poverty – those that do not have sufficient access to modern energy sources suffer poor living conditions as a result.

### The second energy problem: those that have access to energy produce greenhouse gas emissions that are too high[](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#the-second-energy-problem-those-that-have-access-to-energy-produce-greenhouse-gas-emissions-that-are-too-high)

The second energy problem is the one that is more well known, and relates to the right hand-side of the scatterplot above: greenhouse gas emissions are too high.

Those that need to reduce emissions the most are the extremely rich. Diana Ivanova and Richard Wood (2020) have just shown that the richest 1% in the EU emit on average 43 tonnes of CO2 annually – 9-times as much as the global average of 4.8 tonnes.[8](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-8)

The focus on the rich, however, can give the impression that it is _only_ the emissions of the extremely rich that are the problem. What isn’t made clear enough in the public debate is that for the world's energy supply to be sustainable the greenhouse gas emissions _of the majority of the world population_ are currently too high. The problem is larger for the extremely rich, but it isn’t limited to them.

The Paris Agreement's goal is to keep the increase of the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and “to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C”.[9](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-9)

To achieve this goal emissions have to decline to net-zero within the coming decades.

Within richer countries, where few are suffering from energy poverty, even the emissions of the very poorest people are far higher. The paper by Ivanova and Wood shows that in countries like Germany, Ireland, and Greece more than 99% of households have per capita emissions of more than 2.4 tonnes per year.

The only countries that have emissions that are close to zero are those where the majority suffers from energy poverty.[10](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-10) The countries that are closest [are the very poorest countries in Africa](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co2-emissions-vs-gdp?yScale=log): Malawi, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

But this comes at a large cost to themselves as this chart shows. In no poor country do people have living standards that are comparable to those of people in richer countries.

And since living conditions are better where GDP per capita is higher, it is also the case that CO2 emissions are higher where living conditions are better. Emissions are high where [child mortality is the lowest](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-vs-co2-emissions-per-capita), where children have good access to education, and where [few of them suffer from hunger](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-children-who-are-stunted-vs-co-emissions-per-capita).

The reason for this is that as soon as people get access to energy from fossil fuels their emissions are too high to be sustainable over the long run (see [here](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-per-capita-vs-fossil-fuel-consumption-per-capita?tab=chart&stackMode=absolute&time=2018&country=&region=World)).

People need access to energy for a good life. But in a world where fossil fuels are the dominant source of energy, access to modern energy means that carbon emissions are too high.

The more accurate description of the second global energy problem is therefore: the majority of the world population – all those who are not very poor – have greenhouse gas emissions that are far too high to be sustainable over the long run.

## The current alternatives are energy poverty or fossil-fuels and greenhouse gases[](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#the-current-alternatives-are-energy-poverty-or-fossil-fuels-and-greenhouse-gases)

The chart here is a version of the scatter plot above and summarizes the two global energy problems: In purple are those that live in energy poverty, in blue those whose greenhouse gas emissions are too high if we want to avoid severe climate change.

So far I have looked at the global energy problem in a static way, but the world is changing of course.

For millennia all of our ancestors lived in the pink bubble: the reliance on wood meant they suffered from indoor air pollution; the necessity of acquiring fuelwood and agricultural land meant deforestation; and minimal technology meant that our ancestors lived in conditions of extreme poverty.

In the last two centuries more and more people have moved from the purple to the blue area in the chart. In many ways this is a very positive development. Economic growth and increased access to modern energy improved people's living conditions. In rich countries [almost no one dies](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/death-rates-from-indoor-air-pollution-vs-gdp-per-capita?time=2017..latest) from indoor air pollution and living conditions are much better in many ways as we've seen above. It also meant that we made progress against the ecological downside of energy poverty: The link between poverty and the reliance on fuelwood is one of the key reasons why deforestation declines with economic growth.[11](https://ourworldindata.org/worlds-energy-problem#note-11) And progress in that direction has been fast: on any average _day_ in the last decade [315,000 people in the world got access to electricity](https://ourworldindata.org/number-of-people-in-the-world-without-electricity-access-falls-below-one-billion) for the first time in their life.

But while living conditions improved, greenhouse gas emissions increased.

The chart shows what this meant for greenhouse gas emissions over the last generation. The chart is a version of the scatter plot above, but it shows the change over time – from 1990 to the latest available data.

The data is now also plotted on log-log scales which has the advantage that you can see the rates of change easily. On a logarithmic axis the steepness of the line [corresponds to](https://blog.datawrapper.de/weeklychart-logscale2/) the _rate_ of change. What the chart shows is that low- and middle-income countries increased their emissions at very similar rates.

By default the chart shows the change of income and emission for the 14 countries that are home to more than 100 million people, but you can add other countries to the chart.

What has been true in the past two decades will be true in the future. For the poorer three-quarters of the world income growth means catching up with the good living conditions of the richer world, but unless there are cheap alternatives to fossil fuels it also means catching up with the high emissions of the richer world.
