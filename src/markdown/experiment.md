## Black Americans are disproportionately burdened.

PM 2.5 refers to particulate matter with a diameter of **2.5 micrometers and smaller**. Because they are so small, PM 2.5 particles can get through the lungs’ defense systems, making PM 2.5 one of the most dangerous air pollutants for human health. Exposure to PM 2.5 can cause a host of health problems, including asthma, heart disease, decreased lung function, heart attacks, and premature death.[6] Lifetime exposure also leaves people, especially children, more vulnerable to respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19.[7,8] Communities of color are being poisoned by this pollution, leaving them with chronic illnesses and leading to premature death.

The current **EPA threshold is 12 micrograms per cubic meter**, 20% higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended limit of **10 micrograms per cubic meter.** Researchers have found that PM 2.5 is harmful at any concentration, and that lowering thresholds even below 10 micrograms per cubic meter could save thousands of lives.[9,10]
